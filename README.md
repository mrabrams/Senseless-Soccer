## Remember Sensible Soccer? Heard of Pico-8? Why not?

A Pico-8 fan demake based on Sensible Soccer. I am not a game developer (not even a developer), but Pico-8 allows anyone to get a game up and running. For those of you who are younger, you can find a bit more information on Sensible Soccer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_Soccer).

I'll keep an updated [itch.io](http://itch.io) page so you can test out the "stable" builds and follow the project.

Suggestions, questions and comments are more than welcome (as soon as there's something that can be shown.
